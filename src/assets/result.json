If you think of any app today, chances are it's using some kind of map. Your app has users, your users have a location, your services are based on that. Still, we find it worrisome to just add that customized, branded, interactive map in our app, because it just might seem too complicated. And we resort to out of the box solutions. Well, good news. The Google Maps JS API is here for you (and it’s been here for the last 15 years, despite you not making the most of it). Today we’ll see how simple it is to add that desired map to your business, brand it to your needs, and go advanced all the way, with this one weird trick that will make other map library users hate you.",

In this talk we’ll go through all the clichés and myths concerning “life achievements”, including the term “life achievements”. In our culture, in our age and time, and in our industry, burnout and the impostor syndrome are real. But so are toxic environments that ask you to overwork yourself. And so are toxic people who like to think that those who “made it” (another cliché we’ll talk about) did so because they got lucky or favored. But let’s take a step back and think for a second. Let’s redefine our goals and choices and let’s think about what drives them. Is a “life achievement” a generally accepted standard? When will you feel that you finally “made it”? Is our perception of success driven by what we really want, or rather by movies, rockstar developers, and the life of Steve Jobs?",

We will briefly discuss use-cases and see how machine learning (and now you and your browser) can help solve everyday problems (such as image recognition, computer vision, pattern recognition, sentiment analysis etc). There will be a live demo, of course, of Angular and TensorflowJs implementation, where we will see how these two work together, and what we can make of this union. At the end of this presentation, the participants will want to rush home and get their hands dirty with the future of web, that is the magic of JavaScript enabled machine learning.",

    "title": "Angular Realtime Interactions with WebSockets",
    "postContent": "Using Angular and WebSockets we will be turning physical motion into virtual motion, in order to perform actions in our browser (navigation, event firing, etc). We will see the integration process step-by-step, resulting in a simple web application using WebSockets, Angular and a plain WebSocket client/server node.js server. Once we launch this application on our phone, it will start sending device motion data from our phone to the browser, using the brand new device event APIs to capture our device’s acceleration, orientation and motion, and our node.js server to perform the transmission. The browser will receive the motion data, and it will translate it into events and actions on the big screen! Tools that are going to be used are the WebSockets API, Angular, RxJS and a little Node.js server. Observable sequences will help us subscribe and listen to incoming messages, firing events in the process. The presentation will be interactive (users connected to the same network will be able to send data with their phone, too).",

    "title": " Getting Real-Time with Firebase and Angular",
    "postContent": "The participants of this workshop will work hands on with Firebase in an Angular application. They will walk along a journey of developing an app with Angular and the real-time magic of Firebase, using the angularfire2 library. Firebase acts as a backend as a service and takes care of real time synchronization across apps and platforms. The participants will learn about and use the main Firebase modules needed to develop a simple social application. They will use Authentication, cloud storage and the Real-Time database. Best practices about application planning will be discussed, like structuring the data in the API and decisions that need to be made in advance. At the end of this workshop, each participant will have created and deployed a simple web application. The workshop needs prior knowledge of web development. Some basic Angular experience is preferable, but not essential. No prior knowledge of Firebase is needed. The users will need a web-development-friendly laptop (preferably a Unix-based system, or Windows with nodejs and npm installed).",

    "title": "Angular - Maps - Users of Apps",
    "postContent": "Maps, today, are an essential of the internet. Think of any app, and you will realize that it uses a map either to just display a location, or visualize data. Most of these apps, however, also use that map as a user interface, where the user can enter their location and receive corresponding, location based services or suggestions. Take for example car services apps (Uber, Beat), dating apps (Tinder), search-and-discovery apps (Foursquare), or any social app (Facebook, Twitter). In this presentation we will see how to create an Angular app that uses the Google Maps JS API and Firebase to match users together according to their chosen location! We will learn about Angular integration with Google Maps, user input on Google Maps and Angular and data display on Google Maps (the user generated data). The presentation will be interactive and engaging, since participants will be prompted to input their location and see the results live on the big screen. We will see code and examples and discuss implementation techniques.",
